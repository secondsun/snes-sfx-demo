# Group: Map.cfg
#
# Map.cfg is the configuration file passed to the ld65 linker.
#
# It consists of two main partsâˆ¶
# * MEMORY describes the memory layout of the SNES and the cartridge
# * SEGMENTS assigns segments to the memory areas specified
#
# In include/Configurations there are several template configuration
# files for different ROM sizes and memory layouts.
#
# For full documentation of ld65 and its configuration refer to
# the <official documentation at https://cc65.github.io/doc/ld65.html>.
