/**
  Group: libSFX documentation

  libSFX is a Super Nintendo assembler development framework. It aims to
  add as little magic and abstraction to the programming as possible while
  removing the tedium of boilerplate and mandatory micro management of
  configuration files.

  By leveraging the ca65 assembler and several macro packs it can
  create object code for‚à∂

  * WDC65816 - also known as S-CPU, the main processor
  * SPC700 - the Sony 8-bit CPU (S-SMP) controlling the sound DSP (S-DSP)
  * GSU - Graphics Support Unit, also known as "SuperFX"

  Using (and optionally extending) the included makefiles and configurations
  it's a relative breeze to get SNES code up and running!

  *Anatomy*
  libSFX consists of a small runtime that mainly initializes the system and
  handles hardware interrupts (which can be redirected in software). The real
  rice of the library are the macros included and documented here.

  _Packages_
  There are also opt-in packages, adding a bit more to the object code size,
  for non-core features like input peripherals and data decompression.
  These are documented in the "Packages" section.

  _Tools_
  The ca65 toolchain and a couple of support tools are included as submodules
  in the libSFX/tools directory. These are the only tools used by the libSFX.make
  makefile, making libSFX pretty much self contained. Running make from the
  repository root will sync the submodules and build the tools.

  _SFX ü§∑‚ÄçÔ∏è_
  Why is it called libSFX? That sounds like a library of sound effects. Well,
  yes it does. However, "SFX" was also how Nintendo refered to the SNES/SFC in
  the very early developer documentation. It was through photocopied binders of
  those documents ‚Äì with severe generation loss! ‚Äì I first learned about the innards
  of the Super Nintendo, and I have lovingly cultivated a habit of using SFX to prefix
  and suffix my SNES code over the years.

  *Get started*
  Clone, fork or download the repository at <github.com/Optiroc/libSFX at https://github.com/Optiroc/libSFX>
  and dive into the <Make> documentation.
