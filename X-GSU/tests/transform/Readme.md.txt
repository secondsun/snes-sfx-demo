Hi Sour, thanks for looking at this.

In this folder there is Test.sfc (the test rom), test_transform.lua (the lua test), and Test.cpu.sym and Test.dbg (memory/label/linking information).

To see the labels problem, run Mesen2 with the Test.sfc ROM and test_transform.lua script. The test lua script will run and display the Mesen provided label address and the expected addresses (from the GSU pov).

Thanks.
